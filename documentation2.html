<ul>
  <li><b>Focus + Project name change</b> <br>
    <p>as the focus was shifted to the interactions rather than the distance between the users, the name of the project was appropriately renamed from ProxyU to withU </p></li>
<br><li><b>Tilt interaction</b><br>
<p>to enchance the interaction, instead of having two types of inputs from the tilt sensor, each movement wil cycle through colors.</p></li>
<br><li><b>Asynchronus Interactions</b>
<p>as there were some unresolved issues the devices sending data to the cloud (overload of inputs, frequent pausing), the devices are set to publish their current state on set intervals</p></li>
</ul>

        <p>The project is still far from being complete, but the basis of the intended structure of the artifact is laid down. There has been a lot of testing and coding to ensure that the devices can communicate through the cloud. There is a lot more to be explored to enrich the interaction users can have with the devices.
        The  physical design of the artifact is still not determined. </p>
