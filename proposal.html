        <h3>context</h3>

        <div class="text_block">
          <p>The context in which we would like to intervene would be the one of relationship with others in our casual, day to day life. The environment is therefore evidently anywhere that can be deemed “casual”, be it at home, in neighborhoods, at
            school or at work. The reasoning behind such a general and somewhat vague definition is the fact that our connection/relationship with our surroundings is a daily-recurring and fundamental part of our existence. Yet, their omnipresence is
            exactly part of the problem.</p><br>

          <p>In order to prevent our brain from being overwhelmed by stimulus, our emotional feedback towards common events (such people close to us that we see on a daily basis) are often greatly subdued and our mind could even be desensitized to
            their presence so that more dramatic reactions; the high and lows of emotions could be saved for more special occasions.
            With the backdrop of modern society, highly efficient communication methods simultaneously made even the sensational events numb and repetitive while isolating us further (physically). Especially during the pandemic, the proportion of
            isolated, unfeeling times of life have drastically increased. The aim of this project is not to help us circumvent the problem as a whole, but to reintroduce these precious feelings , fleeting experiences of excitement and emotions that
            have been lost. At the same time, hopefully make people more aware of the emotions and connections that make up their life.
          </p><br>
          <p>As for the intended user, in truth it is for everyone and anyone that is more or less isolated emotionally and physically in their connection to their surroundings But more specifically so for those that are completely lost in their
            world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Potential relationships & experiences</h3>
        <div class="text_block">
        <p>  The artifact, which is potentially a bracelet, has the ability to track and monitor, making the device more of a tool. As the main characteristic of the device is to indicate the proximity between the user and the other half of the artifact, the users can become more or less aware of their surroundings. The owners of the bracelets can be inclined to stay near each other. The users can be at loss in their environment when focusing too much on finding the other half. People can feel more at ease with knowing where the other party, or object, is. The two individuals can feel a sense of connection with their partner through the bracelet. While the intention of the artifact is to keep the paired devices close to each other, or at least be more aware of the distance between them, the bracelets become a useful tool (a safety precaution) to be more mindful about the other half to ensure they are not lost or too far away.</p><br>
  <p>The artifact becomes a subtle and informative tracker for the user to keep in check with the other party. Knowing the approximate location of one’s “belongings” can essentially give the user a sense of security and save some stress as they do not need to worry about being lost or unaware of the location. However, this effect can also go the opposite way by making the user worry when the device is not able to locate the other half.
</p> <br><p>  The owners of the artifact essentially gain information of the other's location by giving away their own info. Even on a more intimate level, like many other modern tracking devices, the users become aware that they must exchange their own location to know about someone else’s. The data may as well be shared to a bigger network, which puts the users privacy in question.
</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Associated privileges</h3>

        <div class="text_block">
      <p>Is there a device or a tool that is exclusively beneficial? To further analyze any invention or design, there cannot be an end product without exploitation (abstract or not). Clocks would not exist today if we did not take materials from the earth and the ideas that began with Archimedes, the first known geared clock inventor. We believe our device will probably help, challenge and act as a psychological prosthesis under the circumstances of the user and/or the environment situated.
      </p><br><p>The advantages of our proximity instrument can be as limited or as extensive depending on how much the user wants to engage with it. For example, it can facilitate interpersonal connection between two parties,  aid in material recovery and, assist in experiencing the environment. A constraining factor, simple as it may seem, is having to consider the material dependency that is necessary to utilize this device. When there is a certain degree of dependency on any material possession, the object tends to become a clutch in our daily lives.
</p><br><p>The value of the proximity device leans on multiple influences that shows us an element of interconnectivity. Just as notions of empowerment are closely associated with other terms such as community and society. One person’s approach to empowerment can be at odds with another person, because an anticipated outcome is to gain control of one’s life through empowerment. So there are intersecting boundaries between giving extra privileges to a device over the user. Our objective is to offer, not necessitate this gadget for users, and present them as gadgets that are only capable of communicating with each other in reality.
</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Interaction design strategies</h3>
          <div class="text_block">
<p>Our intentions are again to offer the user the potential to connect with another user or object. Fundamentally, we will attempt to construct tangible devices that will communicate with each other. For practical purposes, perhaps bracelets or necklaces that are visually an indication of a possibility that it could be worn. We seek to make a device that will lack as much direct user to object interaction as possible. Therefore, this accessory would not take up too much physical space. There will be only one button that will function as an on/off, cycle (between options) and synchronize button. Lights as well as vibrations will be an indication to the user. As soon as an individual setting is specified, the user’s only task will be to analyze what the device is communicating to them.
</p><br><p>To make it a more comprehensive product, the user will have an option to choose between different engagements. A visual model, where the device will flash through colors of cool and warm tones. A contact model of patterned vibrations or an audio interaction. Since we want to present a device that would limit direct user to object interaction, the object itself will also have an option for the user to limit it’s exchange of information. A ideall setting while using the proximity device is when the user benefits from the awareness of their own existence in space in relation to another user (/thing). It is in a sense, a consensual geo-locating apparatus.  </p><br>
<p>Again, this is an accessory that is tasked to connect people. Each device is established to work co-dependently with each other. Meaning if there is no intention for any form of distanced relationship, these devices are not essential. </p>
