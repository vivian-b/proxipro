<h2>The Project</h2>

    <h3>about</h3>

  <div class="text_block">
As the main goal of the ProxyU is to indicate the proximity between the user and the other half of the artifact, the users can become more or less aware of their surroundings. The owners of the bracelets can be inclined to stay near each other. The users can be at loss in their environment when focusing too much on finding the other half.
People can feel more at ease with knowing where the other party, or object, is. The two individuals can feel a sense of connection with their partner through the bracelet. While the intention of the artifact is to keep the paired devices close to each other, or at least be more aware of the distance between them, the bracelets become a useful tool (a safety precaution) to be more mindful about the other half to ensure they are not lost or too far away.
