<h2>The Project</h2>

    <h3>about</h3>

  <div class="text_block">
    The project aims to explore the possible interactions between
    two users using an artifact that communicate through the
    cloud. Reflecting on the current state of the world where
    people must keep their distance, the direction I was going
    for was a long-distance device to reconnect two individuals
    intimately. I explored the types of sensors that could help send
    a type of visual, audio or coded message to the other party. I
    uncovered distinct affordances of the sensors that will be used
    and figured out the types of interactions that could help with
    the initial motive of connecting two users.
